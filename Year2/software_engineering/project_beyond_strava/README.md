## üöÄ Project Overview

Welcome to our client-server application designed to empower advanced analysis of personal fitness data from Strava! This project blends a Flask web service, MongoDB Atlas backend, and a Python client library for seamless data retrieval and processing.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

### Step 1: Populate the Database  
Our journey begins with running `populate_db.py`. This script seeds our MongoDB Atlas database with Strava fitness data ‚Äî the foundation for all future analysis.

### Step 2: The Web Service  
The `web_service` package is the heart of our backend:

- Manages **two main collections**:  
  - `athlete` ‚Äî stores athlete profiles  
  - `activities` ‚Äî stores activity records linked to athletes via `athlete_id` foreign key  
- Implements RESTful API routes supporting **GET, POST, PUT, DELETE** operations on both collections  
- Returns all data in clean JSON format for easy consumption

### Step 3: The Client Library  
`client_lib` is our Python client package that:

- Makes HTTP requests to the Flask web service  
- Transforms JSON responses into Python dictionaries and objects  
- Provides reusable functions to retrieve and process athlete and activity data  

### Step 4: Utility Scripts & Demo  
- Utility scripts (`utils_*.py`) contain helper functions to analyze and manipulate the data  
- `demo.py` offers an interactive CLI menu for managing athletes, activities, and performing advanced analyses ‚Äî giving you a hands-on experience
